# Hi, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

As an Embedded Engineer with a specialisation in IoT product development,
I bring a rare balance of technical precision and strategic insight. From
early concept prototyping to production scaling, I thrive on building solutions
that are as robust in code as they are thoughtful in user experience. With
hands-on experience across firmware, app and cloud integration, HMI, and UX,
I see the big picture without missing the crucial details.

My 15 years in tech include both individual contributions and roles that
pushed me to lead, mentor, and manage products end-to-end. Whether driving
a project from the code level or guiding a team to meet ambitious goals, Iâ€™m
ready to take on challenges in both technical and leadership roles, including
product and people management.

While IoT remains my specialty, Iâ€™m excited to apply my skills across sectors
that can benefit from my technical expertise, innovation and problem-solving
abilities.
