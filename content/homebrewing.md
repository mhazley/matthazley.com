I am an incredibly zealous and motivated Home Brewer and have been honing my
skills for about 10+ years.

In 2019 while living in Bristol, I founded
[Homebrew Collab](https://homebrewcollab.co.uk/) which quickly grew to
be one of the largest and most celebrated Homebrew clubs in the South of
England. As of 2024, Homebrew Collab also runs the
[UK National Homebrew Competition](https://nationalhomebrewcompetition.org.uk/).

In late 2024 I moved back to Belfast and am in the process of setting up the
Belfast Chapter of Homebrew Collab, so if you are a Northern Irish Homebrewer,
please get in touch.

Myself and my fellow Homebrewers can be found hanging out on the
[Homebrew Collab Discord](https://discord.gg/eKzsEtQpDH) so please come say hello!
