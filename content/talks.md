I enjoy delivering talks and lectures, and over the years, I've been lucky
enough to have some of these recorded.

## _"What's the Matter?"_ @ Codiax 2023 in Cluj, Romania

I was really happy to be invited to Codiax in 2023 to talk about the future
of Smart Home prototcols. Cluj is a really amazing place filled with incredibly
smart and creative people, I can't wait to go back!

## _"From Beer Making to Corporate Bliss via a Failed Startup"_ @ SW Mobile in 2019

This was a fun talk I developed around my journey from a failed startup to a big
corporation. The concept of this talk was born out of an evening of beers with a
D&D nerd who thought it would be fun to map the hero's journey to an early career
journey.  

I'm really impressed with the cool, minimalist graphics I did for this, maybe
I should add branding to my CV?!

## _"ELi5 Rapid Product Development of the BrewBot"_ @ Farset Labs in Jan 2016

A very young, green engineer tries to explain what it's like to rapidly develop
connected products.
