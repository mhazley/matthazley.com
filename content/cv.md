## Occupation History

### Dyson
**2023-2024:**
_Principal Embedded Connectivity Engineer_, Bristol  
**2021-2023:**
_Associate Principal Embedded Connectivity Engineer_, Bristol  
**2017-2021:**
_Senior Embedded Connectivity Engineer_, Bristol  

At Dyson, I led the development of IoT products from concept to prototype, leveraging BLE, Wi-Fi, and Mesh/Cellular technologies
across C, C++, Python, and Go platforms. I specialised in M2M/IoT protocols such as BLE, MQTT, and CoAP, architecting embedded
solutions that interfaced with cloud services and mobile apps, and designed custom PCBs for specialized devices. 

I was a key figure in shaping Dyson's Smart Home Strategy with Matter and I served as both Matter expert and CSA ambassador. 
I chaired the Air Quality Tiger Team in the Matter Working Group and contributed to the Matter v1.2-1.4 standards, where I introduced 
the Air Purifier and Air Quality Sensor specifications and contributed significantly to the Robot Vacuum Cleaner specification.
These specification additions allowed Dyson devices to be connected into any Smart Home Network that supported Matter and I worked closely
with Apple, Google, Amazon and Samsung to ensure these devices were supported.

I also operated as a Tech Lead and Product Owner for multi-disciplinary teams, where I oversaw end-to-end feature development including 
firmware, mobile, and cloud components. I researched and implemented emerging technologies including Thread, LPWAN, and Matter on embedded Linux,
while managing and mentoring a team of five engineers and advancing the company's connected product strategy.

**2016-2017:**
_Advanced Firmware Engineer_, Malmesbury

As an Advanced Engineer on Dyson's robotics platform team, I developed a robust, scalable platform using C on ARM MCUs with μC/RTOS.
I designed and implemented a company-wide serial communications protocol for high-level systems and low-level peripherals, which
became integral to nearly all Dyson products. 

I also created widely-adopted peripheral emulators in Python/PyQT that streamlined testing and accelerated development cycles across Dyson's
embedded teams.

### Brewbot
**2015-2016:**
_Firmware Lead_, Belfast

As Firmware Team Lead and sole Firmware Architect at Brewbot, I led a team of three engineers to develop an IoT-enabled automated brewing
system from concept to completion in 12 months. Using Particle's Wi-Fi platform (STM32 ARM Cortex M3), I developed firmware in C++ that
controlled all brewing processes and enabled machine-to-cloud communication via MQTT and CoAP. I maintained our build system using Python
and Docker, managed the team using SCRUM methods, and operated our 200L pilot brewing kit to gather real-world testing data and customer
feedback.

### Sensata
**2014-2015:**
_Firmware Engineer_, Belfast

As part of the Automotive Innovation Team at Sensata, I developed RF-based fluid level sensing technologies for a new Audi platform. Working
with 8-bit 8051 MCUs in C, I implemented core product features, created a 1-Wire debug interface, developed an MCU bootloader, and integrated
ECU communication via J2716 SENT. I also built testing and calibration tools in C++/Qt for Windows, streamlining our development process. In
this small, agile team environment, I regularly presented technical decisions to global customers, effectively communicating complex engineering
concepts to diverse stakeholders.

### NYSE Euronext
**2013-2014:**
_Platform Software Engineer_, Belfast

At NYSE Euronext's Platform Team, I developed and maintained Data Fabric, a high-performance, low-latency middleware platform for financial data
distribution. Working in C on Linux systems, I implemented production-grade code utilizing Infiniband hardware for RDMA and Kernel Bypass in this
multi-threaded system. I managed the Data Fabric Lab, providing customer support and issue triage, while creating Python tools to improve diagnostics
and streamline processes across development, QA, and support teams.

### Schrader Electronics
**2009-2013**
_Embedded Software Engineer_, Belfast

As a Firmware Engineer in Schrader Electronics' New Products Group, I designed and developed firmware for industrial sensing solutions. Working with
SiLabs 8051 MCUs, I created low-power, bare-metal solutions (<64kB) using 433MHz Manchester-Coded RF for reliable communication. I managed projects
from initial breadboard concepts to in-situ prototypes, developing compact solutions that met strict power efficiency requirements in challenging
industrial environments.

## Hobbies & Interests

I am an enthusiastic Home Brewer who regularly competes in competition. I have set up various [Homebrew clubs](https://homebrewcollab.co.uk/)
and I like to partake in the community, where I encourage Home Brewers to come together to share knowledge, techniques and advice (and beer!).

I love hiking and I am also a [diverse music fan](https://open.spotify.com/user/matthazley?si=EPZPzeZJQGClYVTFNUN3yg) and like to attend
as many gigs as I can afford.
