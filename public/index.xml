&lt;h2 id=&#34;occupation-history&#34;&gt;Occupation History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dyson&#34;&gt;Dyson&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2023-2024&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Principal Embedded Connectivity Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, Bristol&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;2021-2023&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Associate Principal Embedded Connectivity Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, Bristol&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;2017-2021&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Senior Embedded Connectivity Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, Bristol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my role as Principal Engineer at Dyson, I spearheaded the development of next-generation IoT products,
guiding concepts from initial research through to working prototypes while driving Dyson&amp;rsquo;s connected vision
and strategy. This role placed me at the intersection of technology and product innovation, allowing me to
shape products that leverage Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi, and advanced Mesh/Cellular technologies across
diverse platforms (C, C++, Python, and Go).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I specialized in architecting and developing embedded solutions that seamlessly interfaced with cloud services,
mobile applications, and even peer devices—becoming a go-to expert in M2M/IoT protocols such as BLE, MQTT, and
CoAP. For cutting-edge prototypes, particularly as devices grew smaller and more specialized, I often designed
custom PCBs to enhance performance and integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key figure in Dyson’s Smart Home Strategy, I represented the company as a Matter expert and ambassador to the
Connectivity Standards Alliance. As a contributor to Matter v1.2, v1.3, and v1.4, I chaired the Air Quality Tiger
Team, leading the introduction of two new device types into the standard. My work established Dyson as a forward-thinking
leader within the CSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to hands-on technical work, I led a team of engineers as a Tech Lead, collaborating with both technical
and non-technical stakeholders to shape and realize product requirements within real-world technological constraints.
Acting as a Systems Engineer and Product Owner, I guided multi-disciplinary teams to bring product concepts to life,
often overseeing complex end-to-end feature development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My role also involved researching emerging technologies, where I explored innovations like mesh networking (Thread,
Bluetooth Mesh), LPWAN (LTE-M, NB-IoT), BlueZ for Linux Bluetooth, and deploying Matter and Docker on embedded Linux
platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside my technical responsibilities, I mentored and managed a team of five engineers, fostering skill development
and growth while advancing Dyson’s innovation roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2016-2017&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Firmware Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, Malmesbury&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Advanced Engineer on Dyson&amp;rsquo;s robotics platform team, I was instrumental in developing a robust, scalable platform
for current and future Dyson products, leveraging C on ARM MCUs with μC/RTOS. My primary responsibility was to design
and maintain the serial communication links between high-level systems and low-level peripherals, encompassing both
middleware and protocol design. This work laid the groundwork for a company-wide serial communications protocol,
which I worked on from inception to adoption — a solution now integral to nearly all Dyson products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond protocol development, I built a suite of peripheral emulators in Python using PyQT. These emulators became widely
adopted across Dyson’s embedded teams, streamlining testing and enabling cross-functional collaboration. This work provided
engineers with reliable, flexible testing tools and accelerated development cycles on complex embedded systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;brewbot&#34;&gt;Brewbot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2015-2016&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Firmware Lead&lt;/strong&gt;, Belfast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Firmware Team Lead and sole Firmware Architect for Brewbot, an IoT-enabled, automated brewing system startup based in San
Francisco and Belfast, I led a team of three engineers to develop a fully shippable product from concept to completion in just
12 months. Built on Particle&amp;rsquo;s Wi-Fi platform (STM32 ARM Cortex M3 with Broadcom Wi-Fi), our system controlled every aspect of
the brewing process, interfacing seamlessly with temperature sensors, flow meters, and load cells, and handling precise automation
across all brewing stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I developed the firmware in C++, enabling robust machine-to-cloud communication (MQTT) and seamless integration with mobile devices
via CoAP. In addition to core development, I maintained our build system using Python and Docker and managed the team’s workload,
releases, and milestones, using a streamlined SCRUM-inspired approach that kept us agile and efficient in a dynamic startup environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond my engineering responsibilities, I also managed our 200L pilot brewing kit, shipping around 10 kegs a week, which provided
crucial real-world testing and a direct line to customer feedback. Despite the rapid pace and ultimate closure of the startup, this role
was a unique opportunity to lead the creation of a pioneering IoT product from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sensata&#34;&gt;Sensata&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2014 - 2015&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Firmware Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, Belfast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Sensata, I was part of the Automotive Innovation Team, where we developed novel fluid level sensing technologies for a new Audi
platform. Working on 8-bit 8051 MCUs with C, I collaborated closely with a small team of engineers to bring our RF-based liquid level
sensing product from prototype to production. My work encompassed implementing all product features, creating a robust debug interface
(1-Wire), developing an MCU bootloader, and integrating ECU communication via J2716 SENT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to firmware development, I created testing and calibration tools in C++ using Qt for Windows, which streamlined the testing
process and significantly supported our calibration work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the small, agile team structure, I frequently engaged in global customer interactions, translating complex technical decisions into
clear, strategic presentations for both engineering and non-engineering stakeholders. This experience enhanced my ability to bridge technical
depth with customer-focused communication, ensuring our solutions aligned with client requirements and industry standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nyse-euronext&#34;&gt;NYSE Euronext&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2013 - 2014&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform Software Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, Belfast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At NYSE Euronext, I was part of the Platform Team, where I worked on the development and maintenance of the Data Fabric product, a high-performance,
low-latency, message-oriented middleware platform designed for distributing large volumes of application-level data across financial systems.
This multi-threaded middleware, written in C for Linux systems, operated on IP network hardware and utilised advanced technologies like Infiniband
to enable RDMA and Kernel Bypass for unmatched speed and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responsibilities included implementing robust, production-grade C code for patches and new feature releases, maintaining system stability in a
performance-critical environment. Additionally, I managed the Data Fabric Lab, providing timely triage for customer issues and collaborating closely
with cross-functional teams. To further support development, QA, and support, I created Python tools that improved diagnostic efficiency and
streamlined processes, ensuring rapid response in a demanding financial services environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;schrader-electronics&#34;&gt;Schrader Electronics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2009 - 2013&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Embedded Software Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, Belfast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Firmware Engineer in the New Products Group at Schrader Electronics, I was responsible for designing, prototyping, and developing firmware for
a range of industrial sensing solutions. Working with SiLabs 8051 8-bit MCUs, I developed low-power, bare-metal solutions with compact footprints
(&amp;lt;64kB) that met strict power efficiency and space constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this role, I took projects from concept on breadboards to in-situ prototypes, enabling real-world testing and refinement. The sensors I developed
used 433MHz Manchester-Coded RF to communicate with base stations, ensuring reliable data transmission across challenging industrial environments.
This hands-on experience allowed me to refine my skills in low-power design and RF communication, contributing to Schrader&amp;rsquo;s portfolio of cutting-edge
sensing technology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy delivering talks and lectures, and over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky
enough to have some of these recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_whats-the-matter_--codiax-2023-in-cluj-romania&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the Matter?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; @ Codiax 2023 in Cluj, Romania&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really happy to be invited to Codiax in 2023 to talk about the future
of Smart Home prototcols. Cluj is a really amazing place filled with incredibly
smart and creative people, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to go back!&lt;/p&gt;
