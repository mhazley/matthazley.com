<strong>Principal Embedded Connectivity Engineer</strong>, Bristol<br>
<code>2021-2023</code>
<strong>Associate Principal Embedded Connectivity Engineer</strong>, Bristol<br>
<code>2017-2021</code>
<strong>Senior Embedded Connectivity Engineer</strong>, Bristol</p>
<p>In my role as Principal Engineer at Dyson, I spearheaded the development of next-generation IoT products,
guiding concepts from initial research through to working prototypes while driving Dyson&rsquo;s connected vision
and strategy. This role placed me at the intersection of technology and product innovation, allowing me to
shape products that leverage Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi, and advanced Mesh/Cellular technologies across
diverse platforms (C, C++, Python, and Go).</p>
<p>I specialized in architecting and developing embedded solutions that seamlessly interfaced with cloud services,
mobile applications, and even peer devices—becoming a go-to expert in M2M/IoT protocols such as BLE, MQTT, and
CoAP. For cutting-edge prototypes, particularly as devices grew smaller and more specialized, I often designed
custom PCBs to enhance performance and integration.</p>
<p>A key figure in Dyson’s Smart Home Strategy, I represented the company as a Matter expert and ambassador to the
Connectivity Standards Alliance. As a contributor to Matter v1.2, v1.3, and v1.4, I chaired the Air Quality Tiger
Team, leading the introduction of two new device types into the standard. My work established Dyson as a forward-thinking
leader within the CSA.</p>
<p>In addition to hands-on technical work, I led a team of engineers as a Tech Lead, collaborating with both technical
and non-technical stakeholders to shape and realize product requirements within real-world technological constraints.
Acting as a Systems Engineer and Product Owner, I guided multi-disciplinary teams to bring product concepts to life,
often overseeing complex end-to-end feature development.</p>
<p>My role also involved researching emerging technologies, where I explored innovations like mesh networking (Thread,
Bluetooth Mesh), LPWAN (LTE-M, NB-IoT), BlueZ for Linux Bluetooth, and deploying Matter and Docker on embedded Linux
platforms.</p>
<p>Alongside my technical responsibilities, I mentored and managed a team of five engineers, fostering skill development
and growth while advancing Dyson’s innovation roadmap.</p>
<p><code>2016-2017</code>
<strong>Advanced Firmware Engineer</strong>, Malmesbury</p>
<p>As an Advanced Engineer on Dyson&rsquo;s robotics platform team, I was instrumental in developing a robust, scalable platform
for current and future Dyson products, leveraging C on ARM MCUs with μC/RTOS. My primary responsibility was to design
and maintain the serial communication links between high-level systems and low-level peripherals, encompassing both
middleware and protocol design. This work laid the groundwork for a company-wide serial communications protocol,
which I worked on from inception to adoption — a solution now integral to nearly all Dyson products.</p>
<p>Beyond protocol development, I built a suite of peripheral emulators in Python using PyQT. These emulators became widely
adopted across Dyson’s embedded teams, streamlining testing and enabling cross-functional collaboration. This work provided
engineers with reliable, flexible testing tools and accelerated development cycles on complex embedded systems.</p>

<strong>Firmware Lead</strong>, Belfast</p>
<p>As Firmware Team Lead and sole Firmware Architect for Brewbot, an IoT-enabled, automated brewing system startup based in San
Francisco and Belfast, I led a team of three engineers to develop a fully shippable product from concept to completion in just
12 months. Built on Particle&rsquo;s Wi-Fi platform (STM32 ARM Cortex M3 with Broadcom Wi-Fi), our system controlled every aspect of
the brewing process, interfacing seamlessly with temperature sensors, flow meters, and load cells, and handling precise automation
across all brewing stages.</p>
<p>I developed the firmware in C++, enabling robust machine-to-cloud communication (MQTT) and seamless integration with mobile devices
via CoAP. In addition to core development, I maintained our build system using Python and Docker and managed the team’s workload,
releases, and milestones, using a streamlined SCRUM-inspired approach that kept us agile and efficient in a dynamic startup environment.</p>
<p>Beyond my engineering responsibilities, I also managed our 200L pilot brewing kit, shipping around 10 kegs a week, which provided
crucial real-world testing and a direct line to customer feedback. Despite the rapid pace and ultimate closure of the startup, this role
was a unique opportunity to lead the creation of a pioneering IoT product from the ground up.</p>
<h3 id="sensata">Sensata<a href="#sensata" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p><code>2014 - 2015</code>
<strong>Firmware Engineer</strong>, Belfast</p>
<p>At Sensata, I was part of the Automotive Innovation Team, where we developed novel fluid level sensing technologies for a new Audi
platform. Working on 8-bit 8051 MCUs with C, I collaborated closely with a small team of engineers to bring our RF-based liquid level
sensing product from prototype to production. My work encompassed implementing all product features, creating a robust debug interface
(1-Wire), developing an MCU bootloader, and integrating ECU communication via J2716 SENT.</p>
<p>In addition to firmware development, I created testing and calibration tools in C++ using Qt for Windows, which streamlined the testing
process and significantly supported our calibration work.</p>
<p>Given the small, agile team structure, I frequently engaged in global customer interactions, translating complex technical decisions into
clear, strategic presentations for both engineering and non-engineering stakeholders. This experience enhanced my ability to bridge technical
depth with customer-focused communication, ensuring our solutions aligned with client requirements and industry standards.</p>
